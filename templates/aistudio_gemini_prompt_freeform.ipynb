Here's a slightly expanded and more versatile version of your chatbot responses, focusing on a consistent tone, empathy, and a proactive approach to resolving issues. I've also added a few new response examples:\\n\\n**Core Principles:**\\n\\n* **Empathy:** Acknowledge the user's feelings (\\\"We're sorry,\\\" \\\"We understand\\\").\\n* **Proactive Solution:** Offer a solution or ask questions to understand the issue better.\\n* **Personalization:** Use \\\"you\\\" and \\\"your\\\" to make it feel personal.\\n* **Professional Tone:** Maintain a polite and helpful demeanor.\\n* **Clear Options:** Provide specific choices when offering a resolution.\\n\\n**Expanded Chatbot Responses:**\\n\\n**General Issues:**\\n\\n* **User:** \\\"The food was cold when it arrived.\\\"\\n    * **Bot:** \\\"We're so sorry your food arrived cold. We understand how disappointing that is. We're working on improving our packaging to keep your meals warm during delivery. Would you prefer a replacement of your order or a voucher for your next purchase?\\\"\\n* **User:** \\\"The delivery was so late.\\\"\\n    * **Bot:** \\\"We sincerely apologize for the delay in your delivery. We're actively working on improving our delivery times. To compensate for the inconvenience, would you like a voucher for your next order?\\\"\\n* **User:** \\\"I got the wrong order.\\\"\\n    * **Bot:** \\\"Oh no, we are very sorry for the mix-up! We'll rectify this immediately. Would you prefer we send the correct order to you right away, or would you prefer a full refund?\\\"\\n* **User:** \\\"I received part of my order but not the full thing\\\"\\n    * **Bot:** \\\"We sincerely apologise for this. We're very sorry your order was incomplete. We'll rectify this immediately. Would you prefer we send the rest of your order to you right away, or would you prefer a refund for the missing items?\\\"\\n* **User:** \\\"The delivery driver was rude\\\"\\n    * **Bot:** \\\"We apologise for the behaviour of our driver. We're very sorry for the inconvenience this caused you. We will address the matter with the driver. Would you like a voucher for your next order?\\\"\\n\\n**Food-Specific Issues:**\\n\\n*   **User:** \\\"It wasn’t spicy at all. Very bland!\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"We apologize if the food wasn't spicy enough for your liking. We definitely want to get it right for you next time! Could you tell us what your preferred spice level is (e.g., mild, medium, hot)? We'll make sure it's adjusted to your taste in the future.\\\"\\n*   **User:** \\\"The food was too sweet for me.\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"We're so sorry the food was too sweet for you. We appreciate you letting us know. Please share your sweetness preference (e.g., less sweet, not at all sweet) so we can prepare your future orders exactly to your liking.\\\"\\n*   **User:** \\\"The portion size was really small.\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"We understand your disappointment with the portion size. We value your feedback and will definitely review this with our kitchen team. To make it up to you, would you be interested in a discount on your next order, or would you prefer a voucher?\\\"\\n*   **User:** \\\"The food was greasy.\\\"\\n     *   **Bot:** \\\"We're sorry to hear that the food was too greasy for you. We'll pass this on to the kitchen to ensure better preparation in the future. Can we offer you a discount on your next order to try something different?\\\"\\n*   **User:** \\\"The food was undercooked.\\\"\\n      *   **Bot:** \\\"We sincerely apologize that your food was undercooked. This is not up to our standards. We can offer a refund or send a new meal immediately. What would you prefer?\\\"\\n*   **User:** \\\"The vegetables were overcooked\\\"\\n        *   **Bot:** \\\"We're very sorry to hear that your vegetables were overcooked. This is not up to our standards. We'll inform the kitchen and in the future, we can ensure your vegetables are cooked to your preference. Could we offer you a discount on your next order to try something different?\\\"\\n\\n**Positive Feedback:**\\n\\n*   **User:** \\\"I loved the food!\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"That's fantastic to hear! Thank you so much for your positive feedback. We're thrilled you enjoyed your meal and hope to serve you again soon!\\\"\\n*   **User:** \\\"Fantastic service as always!\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"Thank you so much for your kind words! We're delighted to know you're enjoying our service. We really appreciate your loyalty and look forward to serving you again!\\\"\\n*    **User:** \\\"The delivery driver was so friendly!\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"Thank you for letting us know! We're so happy you had a great experience with our delivery driver. We'll make sure they receive your positive feedback.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Improvements and Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Variety:** The responses vary more in phrasing, avoiding repetition.\\n*   **Probing Questions:** The chatbot asks more follow-up questions to better understand preferences.\\n*   **Clear Options:** Offers clear options (\\\"replacement,\\\" \\\"refund,\\\" \\\"voucher,\\\" \\\"discount\\\").\\n*   **Consistency:** Maintains a professional and helpful tone throughout.\\n*   **Flexibility:** Can handle different types of complaints with appropriate responses.\\n*   **Personalized experience:** The responses are focused on the customer and their specific issue.\\n\\n**How to use it:**\\n\\n*   **Pattern Matching:** You can use pattern matching or keyword analysis to identify the general topic of the complaint (e.g., \\\"cold,\\\" \\\"late,\\\" \\\"wrong\\\").\\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Use keywords or phrases to select a more specific response (e.g., \\\"too sweet\\\" triggers a sweetness-related response).\\n*   **A/B Testing:** Test different responses to see which performs best (e.g., which incentive leads to more repeat orders).\\n\\nLet me know if you'd like any adjustments or more examples!\\n \n",

We take allergies extremely seriously and we apologize profusely for this. We will be retraining our staff and kitchen to ensure this doesn't happen again. We will offer a full refund and a voucher for your next order.\\\"\\n\\n**Order Modifications and Special Requests:**\\n\\n*   **User:** \\\"I asked for no onions, but they were included.\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"We apologize that your specific request for no onions was missed. We'll ensure our staff pays closer attention to special instructions moving forward. We will gladly send a replacement order made to your specification. Would that be okay?\\\"\\n*   **User:** \\\"I requested a specific delivery time and it was not honoured.\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"We're very sorry that your requested delivery time was not met. We understand how important timely deliveries are. We can offer a voucher for your next order - or would you prefer a refund of your delivery fee?\\\"\\n\\n**Customer Service and Communication:**\\n\\n*   **User:** \\\"I tried to call but no one answered.\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"We apologize that you had trouble reaching us by phone. We're working to improve our customer service availability.

We will rectify this by offering a refund for the item, or by sending the item to you directly. Which would you prefer?\\\"\\n*    **User:** \\\"I got a totally different cuisine than I ordered!\\\"\\n    *  **Bot:** \\\"We sincerely apologise for this. This is definitely a big mistake and we are not happy this happened. We'll send the correct order right away or issue a full refund and a voucher for your next order. What would you prefer?\\\"\\n\\n**Positive Feedback with Specific Mentions:**\\n\\n*   **User:** \\\"The delivery driver was so friendly and efficient!\\\"\\n    *   **Bot:** \\\"That's wonderful to hear!

Thank you for trusting our suggestion!\\\"\\n* **User:** \\\"Your app was very easy to use and order!\\\"\\n     *  **Bot:** \\\"Thank you for letting us know! We're so happy you enjoyed your experience with our app and we will continue to try to improve it. We look forward to serving you again soon!\\\"\\n\\n**Key Takeaways from these expansions:**\\n\\n*   **Increased specificity:** The scenarios now address more precise issues related to food quality, packaging, service, and special requests.\\n*   **More varied responses:** The bot is more flexible in how it responds, offering different types of solutions and showing empathy in various situations.\\n*   **Addresses less common issues:** The scenarios now cover some of the less frequent but still important customer pain points, like missing items, or communication difficulties.\\n*   **Highlights positive interaction:** Positive feedback responses are more specific and mention the reason behind the positive sentiment.\\n\\nThis expanded set of scenarios should make your chatbot even more capable of handling a wider range of customer interactions. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!\\n \n",
